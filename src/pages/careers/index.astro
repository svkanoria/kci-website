        We make building blocks for some of the most ubiquitous infrastructure
        needed in our daily lives, which means our products make their way to
        over a billion people.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see this as strong motivation to not only do our best, but to always
        push our boundaries. This means working with a talented, close-knit
        group of people on cutting edge technologies and innovative products. Of
        course, with the utmost care for safety and the environment, as our
        numerous awards over the years show.
